It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out.</p>\n<p>And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. And right there you got an almighty cloud. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. We'll do another happy little painting. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special.</p>\n<p>Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Have fun with it. There comes a nice little fluffer. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/img/averie-woodard-111831-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"man standing\"></p>\n<p>We'll have a super time. Let's put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn't forget them. Let's have a happy little tree in here.</p>\n<p>Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. Let's build an almighty mountain. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us.</p>\n<p>Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. Don't fight it, use what happens.</p>\n<p>Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Every time you practice, you learn more. Do an almighty painting with us. Poor old tree.</p>",fields:{slug:"/its-night-and-theyre-sleeping/"},frontmatter:{author:"Jimmy C",date:"July 18, 2018",title:"It's night and they're sleeping.",description:"What do you think they dream about",color:"orange",smTitle:"Nighttimes is scary",smDescription:"My succulents go to sleep",tags:["succulents","night","sleep","bob ross"],image:"/img/averie-woodard-181273-unsplash.jpg"}},relatedPosts:{edges:[{node:{id:"/Users/jimmy/Desktop/gatsby-netlify-cms-blog/src/pages/wait-one-of-them-looks-wrinkly.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{title:"Wait one of them looks wrinkly",description:"Is this the beginning of the end",color:"blue"},fields:{slug:"/wait-one-of-them-looks-wrinkly/"}}},{node:{id:"/Users/jimmy/Desktop/gatsby-netlify-cms-blog/src/pages/its-night-and-theyre-sleeping.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{title:"It's night and they're sleeping.",description:"What do you think they dream about",color:"orange"},fields:{slug:"/its-night-and-theyre-sleeping/"}}},{node:{id:"/Users/jimmy/Desktop/gatsby-netlify-cms-blog/src/pages/my-succulents-are-doing-just-fine.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{title:"My succulents are doing just fine",description:"I tell ya.",color:"purple"},fields:{slug:"/my-succulents-are-doing-just-fine/"}}},{node:{id:"/Users/jimmy/Desktop/gatsby-netlify-cms-blog/src/pages/so-many-shades-of-green.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",frontmatter:{title:"So many shades of green",description:"Like infinite.",color:"teal"},fields:{slug:"/so-many-shades-of-green/"}}}]}},pathContext:{id:"/Users/jimmy/Desktop/gatsby-netlify-cms-blog/src/pages/its-night-and-theyre-sleeping.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",tags:["succulents","night","sleep","bob ross"]}}}});
